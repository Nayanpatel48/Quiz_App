#  this code is organizing your API into different departments.

# Analogy: A Department Store üè¨

# Think of your main application app as a large department store. Instead of putting everything in 
# one big messy room, you create separate departments for different things.
#     auth.router : This is the Security Department (handles logins).
#     history.router : This is history department (handles history fetching from postgresql database)

# Each line of code does two main things:
#     app.include_router(...) : This tells your main store, "Set up and include this new department."
#     prefix="/api/..." : This gives each department its own unique address or aisle number. For example, 
#                           all routes inside the users.router will now start with /api/users/. This 
#                           prevents confusion between 
# departments.
